Utilize Laravel Processes to run PHP code asynchronously.

## What really is this?
[Laravel Processes](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/processes) was first introduced in Laravel 10. This library wraps around `Process::start()` to let you execute code in the background to achieve async, albeit with some caveats:
- You may only execute PHP code
- Restrictions from `laravel/serializable-closure` apply (see [their README](https://github.com/laravel/serializable-closure))
- Hands-off execution: no built-in result-checking, check the results yourself (e.g. via database, file cache, etc)

## Why should I want this?
This library is very helpful for these cases:
- You want a minimal-setup async for easy vertical scaling
- You want to start quick-and-dirty async tasks right now (e.g. prefetching resources, pinging remote, etc.)
  - Best is if your task only has very few lines of code

Of course, if you are considering extreme scaling (e.g. Redis queues in Laravel, multi-worker clusters, etc.) or guaranteed task execution, then this library is obviously not for you.

## Installation
via Composer:

```sh
composer require vectorial1024/laravel-process-async
```

## Change log
Please see `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Example code
Tasks can be defined as PHP closures, or (recommended) as an instance of a class that implements `AsyncTaskInterface`.

A very simple example task to write Hello World to a file:

```php
// define the task...
$target = "document.txt";
$task = new AsyncTask(function () use ($target) {
    $fp = fopen($target, "w");
    fwrite($fp, "Hello World!!");
    fflush($fp);
    fclose($fp);
});

// if you are using interfaces, then it is just like this:
// $task = new AsyncTask(new WriteToFileTask($target, $message));

// then start it.
$task->start();

// the task is now run in another PHP process, and will not report back to this PHP process.
```

## Testing
PHPUnit via Composer script:
```sh
composer run-script test
```
